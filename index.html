                            Personal Computer (PC) gamers all over the globe, and as such, analyzing the <b>geographic distribution</b> of its userbase offers a

                            Indeed, it can be seen that there exists a high concentration of PC gamers in <b>high-income, developed nations</b> like <b>the United States</b>

                            This sort of data is crucial for companies that manufacture <b>PC Gaming Hardware</b> as it helps them to pinpoint which markets they should focus and to <b>identify

                            Of the 3 major GPU manufacturers in the market, <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA</b> has emerged as the clear market dominator, with <b>over 75% of Steam users</b>

                            One big reason why Steam users overwhelmingly prefer <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA</b> GPUs has to do with their <b>high performance</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p style = "font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif">
                            Performance is an important factor for PC gamers when picking and choosing which graphics cards they want to have in
                            their computers because they can <b>derive more enjoyment</b> out of video games when playing them at the <b>best
                            graphical settings</b> with the <b>highest frame rates</b>, and powerful GPUs are necessary to enable this.
                        </p>

                        <p style = "font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif">
                            With that in mind, it should be no surprise then why so many Steam users seem to prefer <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA's</b> GPUs over that
                            of their competitors. After all, <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA's</b> GPUs consistently outshine their competition in terms of <b>graphical fidelity</b> 
                            and <b>frame rates</b>, and this can be clearly seen in PC Gamer's hierarchy of the Top 10 GPUs in 2024, where <b>7 out of the 10</b> very best
                            GPUs in 2024 were manufactured by <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p style = "font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif">
                            In fact, the <b>top 3 spots</b> in the ranking were held by <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA</b> GPUs, whereas
                            <b style = "color: #6a51a3">AMD's</b> strongest-performing graphics card only managed to cinch fourth place.
                            This lends credence to the notion that <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA's</b> GPUs are <b>generally stronger</b> compared to those manufactured by their
                            competitors.

                            The notion that <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA's</b> GPUs are several times stronger than those which are produced by their competitors is best exemplified via a
                            comparison of <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA's</b> flagship GPU (the RTX 4090) with <b style = "color: #6a51a3">AMD's</b> flagship GPU (the RX 7900 XTX). These
                            flagship GPUs represent the <b>highest-end, top-performing GPU of their generation</b> and this is reflected in not only
                            their steep price but their performance in games.

                            From the chart, we can see that <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA's</b> RTX 4090 completely blows <b style = "color: #6a51a3">AMD's</b> RX 7900 XTX out of the water in terms of
                            average <b>frames-per-second</b> (FPS) at 4K resolution and the highest graphical settings in the following 6 games:
                            Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3, Red Dead Redemption 2, Deathloop, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Cities: 
                            Skylines II. 
                            In all 6 games, <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA's</b> <b>RTX 4090 delivered a higher average FPS</b> than <b style = "color: #6a51a3">AMD's</b> RX 7900 XTX did and often
                            did so by a significant margin as well.

                        <p style = "font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif">
                            Combining all of this data with our knowledge that the vast majority of Steam users reside in <b>developed, Western nations</b>,
                            and as such are very likely to have the <b>disposable income</b> to afford the strongest-performing GPUs, we can easily see that

                            its stock price has been <b>steadily trending upwards</b> throughout the years <b>2022 to 2024</b>. 
                            Furthermore, it can be seen that its current stock price in 2024 is <b>4-times</b> what
                            it was during the start of 2022.

                            This could be explained by the fact that in <b>October 2022</b>, <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA</b> released the first model of their
                            RTX 40 series of graphics cards onto the market, starting with their flagship <b>RTX 4090</b>. The rest of the
                            RTX 40 series soon followed suit, with the <b>RTX 4080</b> entering the market in <b>November 2022</b> and the <b>RTX 4070</b>
                            arriving in <b>April 2023</b>.

                        <p style = "font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif">
                            As we have seen earlier, the RTX 4090 was an <b>absolute powerhouse</b> of a graphics card, and the other graphics
                            cards in the RTX 40 series have all been <b>ranked very highly</b> in terms of performance.

                            Naturally, this has all
                            resulted in <b>very strong sales</b> and <b>sky-high revenues</b> for <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA</b>, culminating

                            These days, <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA</b> makes a majority of their revenue from their <b>data centre operations</b>, capitalizing on the

                            That said, gaming continues to be the <b>second-largest source of revenue</b> for the company,

                            For that reason, it is very important for <b style = "color: #094001">NVIDIA</b> to continue to invest in their <b>gaming</b> department, not just
                            by investing in <b>research & development</b> to develop more powerful graphics cards, but in identifying <b>previously-untapped</b>
                            and <b>emerging</b> GPU markets so that they may gain a foothold there before their competitors like <b style = "color: #6a51a3">AMD</b> and <b style = "color: #4c9dd4">Intel</b> can.
